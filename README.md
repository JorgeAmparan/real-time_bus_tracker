# Real Time Bus Tracker
## MTBA Route #1 Bus Tracker in Real Time
> This is an exercise that I carried out as part of a project with my course MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. 
> The main purpose of this project is to show bus locations in real time as they move on a daily basis throughout their routes in the city of Boston.

> If you'd like to run this project in your machine: 
   * First create 3 files: index.html, style_sheet.css and java_script.js
   * Then copy code from files on this repository for each htmal, css and js file, accordingly.
   * Also, you'll need to add 2 image PNG files to be used as icons whose dimentions can be from 100px x 100px to 200px x 200px. One file must be named Blue (Blue.png) and the other file Red (Red.png).

Once you have copied code and made sure you have all these necessary files on the same folder, you can just add your html (index.html) file to a blank web browser and you'll be set to watch bus tracking in real time!  

> Other useful information
  Users can hover on the bus in order to know the bus ID and current bus route.
